SIMILIARITY SCORE (SS) IS CALCULATED AS FOLLOWS

Let ASD = average sentiment score difference (average of the sentiment score for all tweets in a user document)
Let SF = shared following (average of the (intersect of following/tota following) for each user)
Let STW = shared top words (number of top 30 words in common)
Let M = mutual (are the user's following each other? 0 if no, 1 if yes)

SS = (SF*100)(M + 1)((STW/30)) - |ASD|

Where SS = similarity score
